Power Monitoring System

Measuring electric values is now easier thanks for this software,
using arduino and python you can easaly transfare, view and store electric values.

this software has two section: 
- Arduino
        You can use analog pins to read voltage from 0 to 5v;
        using voltage divider or any other circuts you can use these pins to read other elictrical values;
        after that, you can send them to PC via Serial Port.
- Python
        python can recive serial port data easaly in Windows, MAC and Linux using PySerial Library
        after reciveng data you can calibrate it and either view, edit or store it in a text log file
        
        
this software written by:
Arduino
python 3.5.4
pyserial
pyQt 5.6
